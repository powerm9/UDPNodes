- [ ] See if we can get a broadcast system working

## The Brief

1. Discover - discover other nodes on the network that you can potentially interact and collaborate with. (10 marks)

2.  Negotiate - negotiate with each of these nodes to discover their offered services, capabilities and constraints, and
to advise them of your offered services, capabilities and constraints. (15 marks)

3. Agreement - shared agreement and consensus on the collaborative activity, service or task to be provided. (15
marks)

4. Action - an action that demonstrates the meaningful and effective use of the agreed consensus which you have just
achieved. (10 marks)

BONUS (up to 4 marks) 
Build into your consensus mechanism: 
1. a capability to detect malicious behaviour intended to meaningfully compromise or adversely impact the consensus approach,  
2. effective mechanismsto anticipate and mitigate such approaches
