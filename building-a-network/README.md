# Building a Network


#Functionality
Once you run this ndoe on your PC it will determine your IP and begin broadcasting on all IP's on your local network.
If another Node or Nodes are running they will then begin communicating. In the menu you can see these other nodes and what "items" they have to offer.
These items can be traded and you will see the outcome updated in the respective tables.

You can also chat with the other nodes!
