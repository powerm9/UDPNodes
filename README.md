# Building a Network

## Functionality

Once you run this code on your PC, it will determine your IP address and begin broadcasting on all IPs on your local network. If other nodes are running, they will start communicating with each other.

### Key Features:
- **Node Discovery**: View other nodes in the network and see what "items" they have to offer.
- **Trading System**: Items can be traded, and the outcomes will be updated in the respective tables.
- **Chat Functionality**: Communicate with other nodes in real-time!

### Nodes:
- **Matthew Power**
- **Maria Meshcheryakova**
- **Sarah Maduwuba**
- **Isabel Ryan**
